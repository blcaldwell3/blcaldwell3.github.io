            This game was created by Blake Caldwell, William Fisher, and Keegan Palmieri. The game is a variation on the classic arcade game Pac-Man.
            The controls are quite similar but the goal is different. The goal in Mock Man is to eat all the dots on the map as fast as you can. There 
            is no point system with Mock Man, the sole goal is to complete the level with the fastest time. Ghosts can and will attack you but you can 
            still eat the ghosts as well. If you believe your time is really good and leaderboard ready, you can screenshot your time and send it to this 
            email address: mockmanleaderboard@gmail.com. Before you send it please confirm that your time qualifies under the leaderboards page. We also 
            ask that you send us a name you want displayed following the traditional Pac-Man format of three letters A-Z. If the format is not met than
            we will not accept the time. If you find any issues with the game or have any other questions regarding us or the game please feel free to 
            contact us at the previously provided email address. Otherwise, good luck and have fun.
